<p>Don't you love one-pot recipes? I love making them. As much as I love to cook, not having a big mess makes me very happy. The curry blend smelled so good and the haddock took on the flavors perfectly! Thanks again, City Fish! This is also a 30-minute meal and a paleo dish! Keep it healthy...</p>
